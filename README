POE-Component-Client-eris

POE Session for the eris event correlation engine.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To install the server component, you need to hook into 
syslog-ng, add this line to your /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf

	destination d_eris { program("PERLBIN/eris-syslog-ng.pl"); };

Replacing PERLBIN for where 'make install' stashed eris-syslog-ng.pl.

Also, send data to it:

	log { source(s_sys); source(s_tcp); source(s_udp); filter(f_whatever); destination(d_eris); };

Restart syslog-ng, and you should be able to telnet to localhost:9514
